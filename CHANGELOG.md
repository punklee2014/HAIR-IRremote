# Changelog

All notable changes to HAIR-IRremote will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0-alpha] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **Protocol-based AC control** via IRremoteESP8266 IRac encoding. Select a protocol (MIDEA, DAIKIN, COOLIX, etc.) and control your AC through the native HA climate entity without learning individual temperature commands.
- Native `irhvac` module compiled from `vendor/IRremoteESP8266/python/` via SWIG, distributed as precompiled `_irhvac.so` for `linux_x86_64` and `linux_aarch64`.
- `AcControlMode` enum (`learned` / `protocol`) on IRDevice, with storage migration to v1.2.
- `device_manager.async_send_raw_timings()` for sending encoded AC timings through the infrared platform.
- Climate entity PROTOCOL branch: full temperature range (16–30°C), all HVAC modes, fan modes, Celsius support.
- WebSocket API: protocol AC fields on create/update device, `hair/protocols` and `hair/protocol/models` commands.
- Frontend: AC device wizard now offers Learned vs Protocol mode with protocol picker and **model enum dropdown** (14 protocols with named models).
- Build infrastructure: `build/build_irhvac.sh`, `build/docker/Dockerfile.irhvac`, CI matrix for native builds.
- ESPHome `ir_rf_proxy` transmit example.

### Changed

- Domain remains `hair` (backward-compatible with HAIR entities).
- Integration display name changed to **HAIR-IRremote**.
- Manifest: requires `infrared-protocols>=2.0.0`.
- Storage version: 1.1 → 1.2 (automatic migration adds protocol defaults).

### Credits

- Forked from [HAIR](https://github.com/DAB-LABS/HAIR) v0.1.2.
- IR encoding powered by [IRremoteESP8266](https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266) v2.9.0.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- Add "Add Device" button to the tab bar, visible in all states including the zero-device onboarding flow. Previously there was no way to add a device when hardware was detected but no HAIR devices existed yet.
- Fix missing Name field in the Add Device dialog on HA 2026.5+ (`ha-textfield` component no longer renders). Replaced with a native input element.
- Always show the HAIR Devices section header even when no devices exist, with an empty-state hint message.
- Remove redundant floating action button from bottom-right corner.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- Fix TX failure on HA 2026.5+ ("Timing object cannot be interpreted as an integer"). The upstream `infrared-protocols` library removed the `Timing` dataclass in v2.0.0, changing `get_raw_timings()` from `list[Timing]` to `list[int]` with signed microseconds. HAIR's `ProntoCommand` and `RawTimingsCommand` adapters now return flat signed integers, compatible with both HA 2026.4 and 2026.5+.
- Add error logging to the send command WebSocket handler. Previously, TX errors were returned to the frontend but not logged in HA logs, making diagnosis difficult.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Config flow with hardware auto-detection (IR emitters and capture providers)
- Options flow for capture timeout and default repeat count
- Device CRUD via WebSocket API (12 commands under `hair/` prefix)
- Signal Sniffer with real-time IR signal monitoring and device grouping
- Pronto hex fingerprinting with S/L pulse-duration pattern analysis
- Per-signal hit counts, last-seen timestamps, and active indicators
- Inline device rename and promote-to-HAIR-device workflow in Sniffer
- Device-level dismiss/restore for noise filtering
- IR command capture orchestrator with asyncio-based resource locking
- Capture provider abstraction with ESPHome, Broadlink, and Mock implementations
- Multi-emitter TX support (broadcast to multiple IR emitters per device)
- Command template system with device-type-aware dropdown picker
- Action mapping system with popover UI for binding commands to entity features
- Entity platforms: `remote`, `media_player`, `climate`, `fan`, `light`, `switch`, `cover`, `button`
- Device manager with storage-backed persistence
- Admin panel (LitElement/TypeScript frontend) at `/hair` sidebar URL
- Branded header banner on admin panel
- Add Device dialog with name, type, and emitter picker
- Device detail view with inline expand, editable metadata, hardware cards, and command list
- Assign Signal dialog with template command picker and existing/new device modes
- Promote dialog for converting sniffer devices to managed HAIR devices
- HACS compatibility and CI workflow with HACS validation
- Unit test suite (383 tests) covering all backend modules
